# Totestra

Totestra is a program that makes random maps for Civilization IV. It
is based on Cephalo's excellent PerfectWorld2 map script, and uses
plate tectonics, meteor, and weather modeling to create a remarkably
realistic earth-like planet. It is an update to PerfectWorld that adds
more parameters that can be set inside Civ IV to the map generator, as
well as fixing some long standing bugs with Cephalo's map generator. One
goal of Totestra is 100% compatibility with PerfectWorld2; given the right
parameters, Totestra will make the exact same map that PerfectWorld2 did.
